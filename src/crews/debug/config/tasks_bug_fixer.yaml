    Bug to fix:
    ```
    {bug}
    ```

    Based on a single bug (bug to fix), implement minimal and safe code
    changes to resolve it, maintaining compatibility and without introducing new
    dependencies.

    Rules:
      - Follow the action plan to fix the bug
      - Prioritize minimal, localized changes
      - Do not modify tests unless the specification is clearly wrong
      - Respect the project's formatting and style

    If no change is required, return [] exactly.
