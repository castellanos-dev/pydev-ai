produce_move_map:
  description: >-
    You are given a JSON description containing move specifications.
    Return a deterministic JSON object mapping each original file path to
    its new path: {"old_path": "new_path"} per entry.

    Normalize the result into a single flat JSON object where keys are old paths
    and values are new paths. Do not include duplicates; the last occurrence wins.

    IMPORTANT:
      - Output JSON only, no prose.
      - Do not infer paths.
      - Preserve the paths as provided (no absolute resolution).
